# Record management system

Record management system (or just RMS) is private record system in FjordCMS for creating lists, records simply and clearly. Everything is dynamic, so you can create cols and specific forms you want to have for adding new data.
RMS has a user-friendly interface in which the data to be stored is simply set, and a dynamic crud mechanism is to be automatically generated for it.

From developer's point of view is this principle named "EAV" (custom relation database tables for entity, attribute, value and row id - joined/related with foreign keys).

RMS can be used by everyone who has permissions in his account.
